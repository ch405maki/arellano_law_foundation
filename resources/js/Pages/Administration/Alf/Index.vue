                      Upon its organization in 1978, the Foundation was privileged to have retired Supreme Court Justice Ruperto G. Martin as the first chairman of its Board of Trustees, with Dean Mariano M. Magsalin, Sr. as vice chairman and Arellano University School of Law cum laude graduate, businessman and law practitioner Eliseo P. Ocampo as executive director. Upon his retirement, Justice Martin was replaced by Dean Magsalin Sr. as chairman, who served until his untimely demise in 1992. Arellano University Chairman and President Florentino E. Cayco, Jr. then took over as chairman of the Foundation. In April 1995 Chairman Cayco died and was replaced by Dean Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura, with Paulino F. Cayco as co-chairman. Dean Mariano F. Magsalin, Jr. was appointed executive director of the Foundation, a position he held until 2007. Thereafter, Retired Justice Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura was elected as chairman, Francisco P.V. Cayco as co-chairman and Atty. Gabriel P. dela Peña as executive director. In 2021 at the death of Justice Nachura, he was replaced by Retired Justice Jose C. Reyes Jr. who sits as chairman as present.
